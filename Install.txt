This is a demonstration of how to use the Python module CFFI to expose C++ code to Python. You'll need the 
Intel C++ compiler suite to run this demo.

Start by running 
$ make
Then
$ python testCFFI_build.py

This builds the extension module _testCFFI.py which can then be imported into Python as shown in the demo
